# Simple QR Code generation with a logo

There are many open-source packages that support QR code generation, but people still pay for a subscription to add a logo. This tiny project helps people to get a simple QR code with a logo for free in no time. It is based on Node.js and express framework, but we only used the most basic functionalities. Take a look at this open-source project [qrcodejs](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs) to customize the qrcode yourself.

## Get Started

If you don't want the trouble to understand how it works but just want a QR code, do the following.

1. Install Node.js properly
2. Run the following two lines of commands in your terminal

```bash
npm install
node server.js
```

3. Go to http://127.0.0.1:3000 to see if it works. You should see a QR code and you can download the image by right clicking it.
4. Replace the image and URL in `/scripts/script` for your project.

Done.
